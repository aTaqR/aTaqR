Present case is built over an existing tutorial 
($FOAM_TUTORIALS/compressible/overRhoPimpleDyMFoam/twoSimpleRotors/)

Geometry borrowed from  Alejandro Roger Ull's work.
(https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam/103804-dynamic-mesh-gear-pump.html)

Tested on OpenFOAMÂ® v1906 (ESI-OpenCFD version) which comes with overset capabilities 
(https://www.openfoam.com/releases/openfoam-v1906/)

In order to use overset meshing in CFD direct's version
(https://openfoam.org/download/)
, either of the following libraries need to be compiled

CASE DETAILS

transient compressible, rotating mesh

meshed using cfmesh
relatively coarse meshing

solved using overset grid 
(more info on https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/latest/doc/guide-overset.html)

no validation
-------------------------
gear0/
    For generating (2D) mesh of bottom gear
    
gear1/
    For generating (2D) mesh of top gear

case_overset/
    For generating (2D) mesh of the casing
    and overset mesh for running the case
